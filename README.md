# 🚲 Bike Rental Demand Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a simple AI/ML project built as part of the **AICTE Edunet Internship**. The objective is to predict the number of rental bikes required on a given day using historical data and basic weather and calendar conditions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Urban cities often face challenges in ensuring the availability of rental bikes at the right time and place. The goal is to **predict the demand for bikes** in advance using machine learning techniques to support a stable and optimized rental bike system.

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

We use the **UCI Bike Sharing Dataset** which includes daily data on bike rentals. The model uses features like weather, temperature, windspeed, and weekday to predict bike rental demand using a **Linear Regression model**.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **UCI Bike Sharing Dataset**
- Download Link: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00275/Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00275/Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip)
- Use the file `day.csv`

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository  
2. Download and extract the dataset above  
3. Place `day.csv` in the same folder as `bike_rental_prediction_swati.ipynb`  
4. Open and run the notebook in Jupyter

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score (Goodness of Fit)

The model predicts daily bike rentals fairly well using basic regression.

---

## 📈 Result Graph

You’ll see a graph comparing actual vs. predicted rentals as output at the end of the notebook.

---

## 🔭 Future Scope

- Use hourly-level data for higher accuracy.
- Use advanced ML algorithms like XGBoost or LSTM.
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
- Integrate real-time weather/event data.
